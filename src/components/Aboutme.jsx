            <p className=" md:w-96 pt-5 ">I am that rare case, or maybe not, where I got into tech from a completely different field. 
                After studying at Tbilisi State University for six years, I realized that medicine was not my passion.
                 While I loved the science and theory behind it, practicing medicine wasn't for me. I had to 
                 choose between continuing to do something that didn't fulfill me or pursuing something that did. 
                 At the age of 25, I decided to take the leap and pursue programming, which had always
                 interested me. I love the process of creation, and programming is all about creation.</p>

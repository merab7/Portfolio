        My name is Merab Todua, and I am a Python developer. I love and enjoy this work very much. I dedicate a significant portion of my time every day to developing in this field and never stop; I am always in the process of learning because there is so much to learn, and I believe this topic is inexhaustible, and coding has a very bright future ahead.

Although I didn't start coding from childhood and transitioned into this field from a different one (medicine), I am certain that the consistent effort I put into this work every day for quite some time now makes me a competitive individual with great potential for development.

If you decide to work with me, I assure you that whatever I undertake, I will see it through to the end and achieve the best possible result.
